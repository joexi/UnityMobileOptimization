## Optimizations

Just like on PCs, mobile platforms like iOS and Android have devices of various levels of performance. You can easily find a phone thatâ€™s 10x more powerful for rendering than some other phone. Quite easy way of scaling:

1.Make sure it runs okay on baseline configuration
2.Use more eye-candy on higher performing configurations:
  * Resolution
  * Post-processing
  * MSAA
  * Anisotropy
  * Shaders
  * Fx/particles density, on/off
